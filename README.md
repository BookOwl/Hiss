# Slither
A Python module for bridging Scratch and Python.

## What is Slither?
Slither is a Python module that uses PyGame to bring Scratch-like features to Python.
[Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) is a programming language developed by MIT that uses block-based scripts to introduce kids to programming.

## How do I run Slither?
Simply clone the repo, move the `slither/` folder into the same folder as the Python script importing it, then simply type `import slither`.
You must have PyGame installed in order to use Slither.

## Why use Slither?
Those just getting started with Python after using Scratch may want to go straight from one GUI to another. Slither allows those people to quickly make simple projects in a matter of minutes, while also learning Python.
