# Hiss
A Python module for bridging Scratch and Python.

## What is Hiss?
Hiss is a Python module that uses PyGame to bring Scratch-like features to Python.
[Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) is a programming language developed by MIT that uses block-based scripts to introduce kids to programming.

## How do I run Hiss?
Simply clone the repo, move the `hiss/` folder into the same folder as the Python script importing it, then simply type `import hiss`.
You must have PyGame installed in order to use Hiss.
